> How youtube video downloaders work(like saveFrom, Tubemate)?

- Firstly lets see how a video streaming works (from viewer perspective)..

- All the Video streaming websites works on the process of storing data packets which they receive via internet connection.. Whenever someone streams a video, these video data packets are compiled together and stored in form of “cache” memory. Thus we are able to see the video.

- Programs like ‘tubemate' intercepts in between these data packets (whenever we choose to download this ‘video' option) and stores them in its own directory (phone storage) and resolves it to particular video format file rather than Temperory cache storage format.

- Thus, we are able to download a video format file.
