# NLP

## WHAT IS NLP?

- NLP is a subfield of linguistics, Computer Science and AI with the interactions with between computers and human language.

- Real world applications of NLP are
  - Chat bots like siri, Google assistant, cortana etc
  - Contextual Advertisments
  - Email Client - spam filtering, Smart reply
  - Social Media - Twiiter sentiment analysis
  - Search Engines

## COMMON NLP TASKS

- Text/Document Classification
- Sentiment Analysis
- Information retrival
- Parts of speech tagging
- Language Detection and Machine Translation
- Converstional agents (Text and Speech based)
- knowledge graph and QA systems
- Text summarization
- Text generation
- Spell checking and grammatical correction
- Text parsing
- Speech to text

## APPROACHES TO NLP

- Heuristic Approach
  - The word <u>_Heuristic_</u> is a mental shortcut that allows people to solve problems and make judgements quickly and efficiently.
    Solving NLP problems heuristically is Heuristic Approach. Examples- - Regular Expressions - Wordnet

- Machine Learning Approach
  - The above approach basically works on rules and here in this approach ML algorithm automatically generates rules for us.
  - Textual data is converted to numerical data first before feeding it to the algorithm's.
  - Widely used algorithm's used in this approach are Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM(Support vector machine), LDA.  

-Deep Learning Approach
  - The ML approach doesn't care about sequence of data but DL approach does it.
  - Feature generation is automatic provided by this approach.
  - Architecture used by DL approach are RNN, LSTM(Long short term memory), GRU/CNN, Transformers(Boom in NLP), Autoencoders.
